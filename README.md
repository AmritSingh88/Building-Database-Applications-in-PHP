## Overview

This course expanded on the fundamentals of PHP by integrating it with **MySQL** to build fully functional web applications. I learned how to connect to a database, retrieve and manipulate records using SQL, and combine form processing logic with persistent storage.

---

## Key Concepts Learned

- Connecting PHP to MySQL using `PDO`
- Performing `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations
- Using SQL `JOIN` to combine data across related tables
- Data validation and user feedback loops
- Session handling and user authentication
- Preventing SQL injection with prepared statements
- Implementing a multi-user CRUD system with form input

---

## Projects Completed

> Code will be recreated and uploaded soon.

- **Autos Database App**: Users can log in, add vehicles (make, year, mileage), and view or delete entries
- **User Authentication System**: Session-based login and logout system with hashed passwords
- **Multi-table Tracker**: Used `JOIN` to associate user-submitted data with user IDs and track relationships

---

## Coming Soon

I’ll be uploading rebuilt versions of each project listed above, including:
- PHP files with comments
- SQL schema and seed data
- Screenshots of the working apps
